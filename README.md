# Scrapers
A growing toolkit for scraping.

# DHQ Scraper
This is an example project for scraping content from open journals.  Using scrapy we capture the following info from Digital Humanities Quarterly.

  - Title
  - Author(s)
  - Year
  - Volume/Issue
  - Link to XML
  - Full Text XML File

Scraping this data allows for biliometric and text analysis of the journal, as well as aggregation of this data with data scraped from other journals in the same format.  
  
To Do: Make a class in pipelines.py to define file_path for meaningful filenames.  Current method (commented out) is preventing files from being downloaded at all.
